# Project TMA4212 Numerical solutions of difference equations with difference methods

In this project we have analysed and found numerical solutions to the traffic equations using Lax-Friedrichs, Upwind, Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack schemes.

## Running code
- Run all files through main.py using the masterflag function.
- 0 to 3 runs individual plots for the different schemes.
- 4 run the time convergence plot for all equations with step size from m=2^4 to n=2^12 and reference solution at 2^(n+1).
- 5 run spatial convergence plot for all equations. Here the step size in space and time, as well as simulation time can be manipulated in spatial_convergence.py.
- 6 plots 3D plots for Lax-Friedrichs scheme.

Constants can be changed in constants.py, but for the convergence-files, some of the constants are in the files.
